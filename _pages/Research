This page summarizes selected professional and applied experiences that shape my research questions and methodological interests.

## Supply-chain and e-commerce experience

### Cross-border e-commerce and logistics operations

Before transferring to UW–Madison, I worked full-time in **cross-border e-commerce and supply-chain operations**. My responsibilities included:

- managing product listings and inventory for overseas marketplaces,
- monitoring order and shipment data to coordinate with logistics providers,
- tracking delays, losses, and customs issues for perishable products.

These experiences gave me a concrete sense of how **logistics constraints, platform rules, and documentation requirements** translate into costs and risks for upstream producers.

### Consulting for rural producers and cooperatives

I have informally assisted rural producers and cooperatives in China in:

- choosing between different sales channels (traditional wholesalers, platforms, processors),
- designing basic SKU and order-tracking systems,
- interpreting platform settlement statements, fees, and discount structures.

This work directly feeds into my academic interest in **bargaining power, risk allocation, and value capture** along agricultural supply chains.

## Fieldwork and research organization

### Fieldwork lead – Majiaba Village, Zigui County, Hubei

As fieldwork lead for a multi-year study of citrus farmers in Majiaba Village, I have:

- designed and implemented **stratified household surveys** on production, marketing channels, and income volatility,
- conducted **semi-structured interviews** with farmers, cooperative staff, and local officials,
- organized and cleaned survey data into anonymized datasets suitable for statistical analysis,
- coordinated field logistics and community communication across multiple visits.

This fieldwork anchors my quantitative models in farmers’ lived experiences and local institutional contexts.

## Teaching-adjacent and visualization work

Although I am not yet formally a teaching assistant, I actively develop **interactive teaching tools** to support learning in probability and stochastic processes:

- **Probability Distributions Map** – an interactive HTML/JavaScript tool that organizes common probability distributions and links them to formulas, parameter interpretations, and typical use cases.
- **Brownian Motion & Geometric Brownian Motion prototypes** – early-stage visualizations for use in statistics courses to build intuition before formal proofs.

These projects reflect my commitment to making **quantitative ideas accessible** to students and practitioners, not only to researchers and specialists.
