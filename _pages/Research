## Rural Livelihoods & Intermediaries

**Majiaba Village, Zigui County, Hubei Province** *Multi-year Fieldwork Project, 2022–2024*

- Conducted in-depth interviews with approximately **200 citrus-farming households**
- Interviewed cooperatives, processing enterprises, e-commerce platforms, and local officials
- Analyzed how different marketing channels (traditional middlemen, cooperatives, direct e-commerce) affect:
  - Income stability
  - Bargaining power
  - Risk exposure
- Developed a WeChat mini-program to help farmers track prices and connect with buyers

## Processing Location for Cross-Border Perishables

*Quantitative Modeling Project*

- Built **network-flow and arrival-rate-conserving models** comparing inland vs. port-based processing
- Applied to products such as konjac and other agricultural exports
- Quantified cost and loss trade-offs under different logistics scenarios
- Used linear programming and simulation to optimize supply chain decisions

## Agricultural Development Patterns & Farmers' Income

*Cross-Country Panel Analysis*

- Analyzed **World Bank panel data** across multiple countries and decades
- Examined how agricultural value-added, mechanization, and structural change relate to farmers' income
- Distinguished between aggregate output growth and actual household welfare improvements
- Applied fixed-effects and random-effects regression models

## Research Methods

My research combines multiple methodological approaches:

| Method | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Ethnographic fieldwork | In-depth understanding of farmer decision-making |
| Semi-structured interviews | Qualitative data on intermediary relationships |
| Survey design & implementation | Quantitative data collection at scale |
| Panel data analysis | Cross-country comparisons |
| Network/optimization models | Supply chain analysis |
| Statistical modeling | Causal inference and prediction |
