I am **Qingze Zhu**. I graduated from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a B.S. in Statistics.

My research interests lie in **development sociology** and **economic sociology**, with a particular focus on how different types of intermediaries shape smallholders' bargaining power and risk exposure.

I am proficient in **Python**, **R (RStudio)**, and **JavaScript**.

I also have professional experience in **supply chain operations** and **e-commerce**.
