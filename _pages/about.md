## 🧑‍💻 Biography

Welcome! I graduated from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a B.S. in Statistics. 

My interests lie in **development sociology** and **economic sociology**, especially how different types of intermediaries shape smallholders’ bargaining power and risk exposure. I work mainly in **Python**, **R** (RStudio), and **JavaScript**, and I also have professional experience in supply-chain operations and e-commerce.

## 🔬 Research Experience

My research focuses on agricultural value chains and rural livelihoods in contemporary China, combining fieldwork with quantitative modeling.

* **Rural livelihoods & intermediaries (Majiaba Village, Zigui County)** Multi-year fieldwork with ~200 citrus-farming households, interviews with cooperatives and local officials, and analysis of how different marketing channels affect income stability and bargaining power.
* **Processing location for cross-border perishables** Network-flow and arrival-rate–conserving models comparing inland vs. port-based processing for products such as konjac, quantifying cost and loss trade-offs under different logistics scenarios.
* **Agricultural development patterns & farmers’ income** Cross-country panel analysis (World Bank data) on how agricultural value-added, mechanization, and structural change relate to farmers’ income rather than just aggregate output.

## 💻 Interactive Visualization

I build small interactive tools that turn probabilistic and stochastic-process concepts into experiments in the browser.

* **Probability Distributions Map** – An interactive map of common distributions. Users click a node (e.g., Normal, Binomial, Poisson) to see the PDF/PMF, parameter meanings, typical modeling scenarios, and simple interactive elements.
* **Brownian Motion Laboratory** – A three-module environment for exploring discrete random walks, Donsker’s bridge, and continuous-time processes (Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, CIR).
