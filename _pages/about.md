Welcome

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a B.S. in Statistics. My interests lie in development sociology and economic sociology, especially how different types of intermediaries shape smallholders’ bargaining power and risk exposure. I work mainly in Python, R (RStudio), and JavaScript, and I also have professional experience in supply-chain operations and e-commerce.

## Research experience

My research focuses on agricultural value chains and rural livelihoods in contemporary China, combining fieldwork with quantitative modeling.

- **Rural livelihoods & intermediaries (Majiaba Village, Zigui County)** – multi-year fieldwork with ~200 citrus-farming households, interviews with cooperatives and local officials, and analysis of how different marketing channels affect income stability and bargaining power.  
- **Processing location for cross-border perishables** – network-flow and arrival-rate–conserving models comparing inland vs. port-based processing for products such as konjac, quantifying cost and loss trade-offs under different logistics scenarios.  
- **Agricultural development patterns & farmers’ income** – cross-country panel analysis (World Bank data) on how agricultural value-added, mechanization, and structural change relate to farmers’ income rather than just aggregate output.

## Interactive visualization showcase

I build small interactive tools that turn probabilistic and stochastic-process concepts into experiments in the browser.

- **Probability Distributions Map** – an interactive map of common distributions. Users click a node (e.g., Normal, Binomial, Poisson) to see the PDF/PMF, parameter meanings, typical modeling scenarios, and simple interactive elements showing how graphs change as parameters change.  
- **Brownian Motion Laboratory** – a three-module environment for exploring discrete random walks, Donsker’s bridge, and continuous-time processes such as Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, and CIR. Users set models and parameters, then visualize sample paths, time slices, and terminal distributions.

## Other experience

Beyond formal research, my background also includes:

- **Cross-border e-commerce and logistics operations**, working with order, inventory, and shipment data for overseas marketplaces.  
- **Informal consulting for rural producers and cooperatives**, helping interpret platform fees, settlement statements, and channel choices.  
- **Fieldwork organization and community engagement** in Majiaba Village, coordinating survey work and follow-up visits with local households and institutions.
