Welcome

I am an undergraduate in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My work sits at the intersection of statistics, rural development, and supply chains in contemporary China, with a focus on how different intermediaries affect farmers’ income, bargaining power, and risk.

## Research experience

I work on questions around agricultural supply chains and rural livelihoods, combining fieldwork with quantitative modeling.

- **Rural livelihoods & intermediaries (Majiaba Village, Zigui County)** – multi-year fieldwork with ~200 citrus-farming households, interviews with cooperatives and local officials, and analysis of how different marketing channels affect income stability and bargaining power.  
- **Processing location for cross-border perishables** – network-flow model comparing inland vs. port-based processing for products such as konjac, quantifying cost and loss trade-offs under different logistics scenarios.  
- **Agricultural development patterns & farmers’ income** – cross-country panel analysis (World Bank data) on how agricultural value-added, mechanization, and structural change relate to farmers’ income.

## Interactive visualization showcase

I build small interactive tools to turn probabilistic and stochastic-process concepts into experiments that students can run themselves.

- **Probability Distributions Map** – an interactive map of common distributions. Users click a node (e.g., Normal, Binomial, Poisson) to see formulas, parameter meanings, typical modeling scenarios, and small interactive elements showing how graphs change with parameters.  
- **Brownian Motion Laboratory** – a three-module environment for exploring discrete random walks, Donsker’s bridge, and continuous-time processes such as Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, and CIR. Users set parameters and watch sample paths, time slices, and terminal distributions evolve over time.

## Courses and quantitative training

I am building a quantitative foundation in statistics, probability, and computation. Representative coursework includes:

- **Statistics & probability:** probability theory, mathematical statistics, regression and ANOVA, financial statistics, data visualization.  
- **Computation & data:** programming in R and Python, simulation, basic optimization and network models.  
- **Mathematics:** calculus sequence, linear algebra, and related supporting math for statistics.

A more detailed list of courses and grades is available on my CV and transcripts.

## Other experience

Beyond formal research, my background includes:

- **Cross-border e-commerce and logistics operations**, working with order, inventory, and shipment data for overseas marketplaces.  
- **Informal consulting for rural producers and cooperatives**, helping interpret platform fees, settlement statements, and channel choices.  
- **Fieldwork organization and community engagement** in Majiaba Village, coordinating survey work and follow-up visits with local households and institutions.
