I am **Qingze Zhu**, an undergraduate student in Statistics at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**. 

My interests lie in **development sociology** and **economic sociology**, especially how different types of intermediaries shape smallholders’ bargaining power and risk exposure. I work mainly in Python, R, and JavaScript.

Currently, I am focusing on agricultural value chains and rural livelihoods in contemporary China, combining fieldwork with quantitative modeling.

I also build small interactive tools that turn probabilistic concepts into experiments.

Feel free to contact me via email: [qzhu237@wisc.edu](mailto:qzhu237@wisc.edu) :)
