## 1. Fieldwork Lead: Rural Livelihoods & Direct-Sales Pilot

**Duration:** *Jul 2021 – Aug 2022* **Role:** Fieldwork Lead  
**Affiliation:** Majiaba Village, Zigui County, Hubei, China

**Year 1:**
- Conducted mixed-methods research on income drivers among ~200 citrus-farming households (stratified survey + semi-structured interviews); produced anonymized datasets and interview transcripts.
- Identified dependence on single sales channels and long intermediary chains as key constraints on bargaining power, price realization, and income stability.
- Interviewed Supply & Marketing Cooperative staff and township officials to compile a 30-year oral history of marketing-channel changes and to assess shifting forms of state and cooperative support.

**Year 2:**
- Designed and implemented the "Orange Warms the Countryside" WeChat Mini Program to pilot direct sales and basic vendor-managed inventory for local households.
- Introduced ABC supplier tiering and simple stock-management practices; over six months, reduced spoilage by ≈25% and helped 10 farmers achieve a collective income increase of ≈¥100,000.

## 2. Independent Research: Agricultural Supply Chain & Processing

**Duration:** *May 2025 – Sep 2025* **Role:** Independent Researcher (supervised by [Prof. Sinan Tas](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/sinan-tas))  
**Affiliation:** University of Wisconsin–Madison

**View:** [Working Paper (SSRN)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5408150)

- Examined how processing-location decisions shape smallholder participation in cross-border agricultural value chains, using China→US konjac trade as a case.
- Built an arrival-rate-conserving network-flow model to formalize trade-offs between "fresh → processed" conversion at origin vs. destination under different logistics and loss structures.
- Found that processing near origin ports can reduce total landed cost by 52.8% ($20,119→$9,492) and effective loss by 62.4%; derived simple rules whose recommendations agree with the optimizer in ≈96% of cases.
- Produced a working paper and fully reproducible code/data package shared with partner cooperatives to support their strategy discussions on near-origin processing and farmer income stability.

## 3. Faculty-Supervised Research: Teaching Technology & Reproducible Research

**Duration:** *Sep 2025 – Dec 2025* **Role:** Undergraduate Researcher (supervised by [Prof. Bo Yang](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/yang-bo/))  
**Affiliation:** Department of Statistics, UW-Madison

**View:** [Results in Visualization Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/visualization/)

- Built interactive course tools and use handouts with JavaScript/Python, including an animated derivation from discrete random walk to Brownian motion; developed a probability knowledge map with hover highlights and click-through links to notes.
- Standardized R Markdown/Quarto outputs: added chunk options, code folding, and show/hide controls to improve HTML readability and reproducibility.
- Developed a Brownian-motion–based classroom model to illustrate income volatility for smallholder farmers under different intermediary and price regimes, using visualizations to prompt discussion about rural risk and inequality.

## 4. Data Analysis Project: Agricultural Development Patterns & Farmers' Income

**Duration:** *Jul 2025 – Sep 2025* **Affiliation:** University of Wisconsin–Madison

- Assembled a multi-decade panel dataset (≈30 years) for 266 World Bank countries for farmers' incomes; harmonized series and handled missing values for cross-country comparison.
- Built an interactive dashboard with world maps, time-series plots, and dumbbell charts comparing top vs. bottom countries and ratios of farmer income to national averages.
- Analyzed relationships between mechanization, value added, and farmer incomes, showing cases where higher aggregate value or mechanization does not translate into proportional gains for farm households.
